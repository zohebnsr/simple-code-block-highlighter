Thanks for installing this plugin.
The plugin works only when you are using code block in wordpress block editor. It won't work for paragraph or header. So make sure when you click on + icon, choose <>Code and then type or paste your code snippet.
Plugin has 2 simple settings. You can choose to show number for each line of code and select dark or light theme.
Copy button is made to copy code only, it will not copy numbers shown there.
please send an email to me@zoheb.org for any query.
